* Setup Kahua


##(toc)

** Preparation

*** Installing Gauche

To use Kahua, you need
[http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/index-en.html Gauche]
0.8.9 or later that supports pthread.  We strongly recommend
using Gauche latest release version. We also recommend setting
Character Encoding as UTF-8.

Try following command to check which version of Gauche installed.

{{{
$ gosh -V
Gauche scheme interpreter, version 0.8.10 [utf-8,pthreads]
}}}


If you have not installed proper version of Gauche, please install new
version.  Do not forget to set "--enable-threads=pthreads" to
configure option.

From Kahua 1.0.3, the configure script check whether Gauche is
installed properly or not.

If you are trying to install on Linux, the script also checks that
NPTL (Native POSIX Thread Library) is available or not.

*** Other requisites

Following things are required to install Kahua.

- sh (bash,ksh or BSD sh) which can use configure script
- make (GNU,BSD,Apple is OK)

In some Linux distributions or install settings, "make" is not
installed.  Please take proper steps.

Additionally, if you want to develop Kahua application, you have to
install autoconf 2.59 or later.

----
** Let's try Kahua

You need to think several elements such as installed directory or
authority, to run Kahua as practical operational environment.  Before
run Kahua as practical operational environment, you'd better install
Kahua and related files to one spot.

*** Install under the $HOME/kahua

If you just want to try Kahua, a recommended way is to install under
your home directory.  By this way you don't need to care about
permissions and user/group settings.

{{{
% tar xvzf Kahua-1.0.6.tgz
% cd Kahua-1.0.6
% ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/kahua
% make
% make check
% make install
% make install-examples
}}}

This will build the system from the source code and install it under
the ${HOME}/kahua directory.  It will help you to add
${HOME}/kahua/bin directory to your PATH.  If you use
HTTPd(kahua-httpd) inside Kahua, you don't need to prepare Web server
like appache.

*** Install under the /usr/local/kahua

If you want to install to system domain, you should install under the
/usr/local/kahua.  By this way you also don't need to care about
permissions and user/group settings by the site-bundle function.

Following example shows that install to the site-bundle called
$Home/site.

{{{
% tar xvzf Kahua-1.0.6.tgz
% cd Kahua-1.0.6
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/kahua --with-site-bundle=$HOME/site
% make
% make check
% sudo make install
% /usr/local/kahua/bin/kahua-package create ~/site
% rm ~/site/app-servers
% make install-examples
}}}

It will help you to add /usr/local/kahua/bin directory to your PATH.

*** Starting Kahua

Execute following command to start kahua.
{{{
% kahua-spvr -H localhost:8888
}}}

Use “-H” or “--httpd” option to start kahua-httpd, HTTPd inside
Kahua.  The arguments of -H is '''[Host:]Ports number'''. Ports number
is must.  Host is able to skip. If you appoint only port number, you
can bind server socket to 0.0.0.0(or[::]).  Be aware that it can be
accessed from external area freely, if you don't set filtering
properly.


In case that you install sample application to the $HOME/site, execute
following command to start kahua.

{{{
% kahua-spvr -H localhost:8888 -S ~/site
}}}

"-S" sets the site-bundle to activate command. Its argument is the
path(full-path or relative path from current directory) of
site-bundle.

Then, start a browser and visit http://localhost:8888/. You will see
and can use one of sample applications, "lambdabooks".

The source code of sample application is in the directory of which
name is same as application name under
"~$HOME/kahua/var/kahua/checkout" or "$HOME/site/app".


*** Starts Kahua as background

kahua-spvr can't demonize itself.  Execute following command to start
as background, simply.

{{{
% (kahua-spvr -H localhost:8888 -S ~/site >>~/site/logs/kahua.log 2>&1 &)
}}}

Shutting off controlling terminal by binding up with "()".

The normal output and normal error output of kahua-spvr should not
redirect to /dev/null because the error message of abnormal exit
appears in normal error output.

On practical operational environment, you can prepare the script that
calls above command line from rc or under the
[http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html daemontools].  The "multilog" is
available to collect the messages of normal error output.

Additionally, on developing environment, you can execute following
command with [http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/ GNU screen].

{{{
% screen -d -m kahua-spvr -H localhost:8888 ~S ~/site
}}}

You can attach by your choice.

----

** Create development user.

The kahua-shell is a front end script that is for connecting to active
worker process and change internal condition, interactively.  You need
to create development user to connect to worker.

The development user of Kahua sets up for itself, so that you need to
create each Kahua's working directory and site-bundle.

At first, starts kahua-admin which is managing Kahua-servers.  From
now on, this instruction assumes that you set the path to the
directory that kahua-admin command is installed.

{{{
% kahua-admin
spvr>
}}}

In case of using site-bundle, you need to use kahua-admin with "-S" or
set environmental variable,KAHUA_DEFAULT_SITE to the path of
site-bundle.

Input following command to this prompt.

{{{
spvr> adduser usrname password
done
spvr>
}}}

For example, if you want to add the user which name is taro and
password is secret, input following command to this prompt.

{{{
spvr> adduser taro secret
done
spvr> lsuser
("steel" "sussman" "taro")
spvr>
}}}

The user "steel" and "sussman" is sample user add by default.  You can
delete them.

In case of site-bundle, there is no default user, so the user "steel"
and "sussman" don't exist.

{{{
spvr> deluser steel
done
spvr> deluser sussman
done
spvr>
}}}

Type EOF(Ctrl-D) to exit kahua-admin.

Now you can use kahua-shell.  In case of using site-bundle, you need
to use with "-S" or set environmental variable,KAHUA_DEFAULT_SITE to
the path of site-bundle.

{{{
% kahua-shell
Welcome to Kahua.
username: taro
password: 
wno type         since        wid
  0 lambdabooks  Sep 27 16:19 gje:2ft3z
  1 wiki-iki     Sep 27 16:19 dej:inai
  2 login        Sep 27 16:19 90j:5hwlk
select wno> 0

lambdabooks(gje:2ft3z)> (map (cut ref <> 'login-name) (make-kahua-collection <kahua-user>))
("admin" "guest")
lambdabooks(gje:2ft3z)>
}}}

The instruction above shows that it connected to the one of sample
application,lambabooks and evaluated expression.

----

** Proper Installation procedure(Obsolete)

If you'd like to install Kahua as root into the system area, you
should know about Kahua a little more, and need to follow several
steps.

*** Users and Processes in Kahua

In Kahua system, there are 3 categories processes. They run under
different user privileges and communicate with each other.

# Kahua Servers(Process: kahua-spvr, kahua-server, kahua-keyserv)
# Kahua Bridges(Process: kahua.cgi, kahua.fcg, kahua-httpd)
# Kahua Administrator and Application Developer (Real users use kahua-admin and kahua-user)

All of them must be able to read and write the same UNIX domain
socket.  And Kahua Servers and Kahua Bridges must be able to read and
write temporary files under the same directory.

*** Create group "kahua"

You should create a new group, and add all above users to it, so that
all Kahua processes communicate with each other via the same UNIX
domain socket.

{{{
# groupadd kahua
}}}

Some operating system has some different commands to do the same
task. Please see your system manuals.

*** Create group "kahua"

You should run Kahua Servers(kahua-spvr and scripts invoked by it)
under a UNIX user privilege only for them. Now we assume the user is
"kahua".

{{{
# useradd -g kahua kahua
}}}

*** Add other users to group "kahua"

Now you should add the user under which Kahua Bridges run and Kahua
administrators and application developers (they are real users) to
group "kahua" created above.  Kahua Bridge CGI scripts
(kahua.cgi/kahua.fcg) are generally invoked by Web server(like Apache
httpd or lighttpd).  We assume that the Web server runs as user "www"
(and you don't use suEXEC).

{{{
# usermod -G kahua www
}}}

You may need to restart the Web server to reflect this change.
Additionally, you don't need to this setting when you use kahua-httpd.

Next to this, you should consider Kahua manager/developer.  Assume
that you are login user and your name is taro, for example.

Execute following command to add taro to kahua group.

{{{
# usermod -G kahua taro
}}}

'''Attention:''' The behavior of "usermod" command is different among
OS.  Please checks the behavior of "usermod" command before execute.

*** Configuration and building

Kahua is made up of almost pure Scheme(Gauche) scripts and a few shell
scripts, but its configuration requires a careful attention.

This is configuration and building process on a real site. 

{{{
% tar xzvf Kahua-1.0.6.tgz
% cd Kahua-1.0.6
% ./configure \
    --with-kahua-user=kahua --with-kahua-group=kahua --with-cgi-user=www \
    --prefix=/usr/local/kahua \
    --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc \
    --localstatedir=/var/local \
    --with-cgidir=/var/local/www/cgi-bin \
    --with-cgilogdir=/var/log/kahua/cgi \
    --with-staticdir=/var/local/www/htdocs/kahua-data \
    --with-fastcgi=yes
% make
}}}

You can use GNU make or BSD make. If you fail with BSD make, Please
try GNU make and report us what is wrong with BSD make.

**** configure options

Please see message of
{{{
% ./configure --help
}}}
but we describe some important options.

{{{
--with-kahua-user

     User name under which Kahua Servers run.  Default: not specified.

 --with-kahua-group

     Group name that all users related to Kahua System must belong to.
     Default: not specified.

 --with-cgi-user

     User name under which Kahua Bridge CGI scripts(kahua.cgi/kahua.fcg)
     run. Generally it is the same user under which the Web server runs.
     Default: not specified.

 --with-cgidir

     Directory path where Kahua Bridge CGI scripts are installed.
     It depends on your Web server configuration.
     Default: ${libexecdir}/kahua

 --with-cgilogdir

     Directory path where Kahua Bridge CGI scripts write out log
     files.  Default: ${localstatedir}/kahua/cgilog

 --prefix, --exec-prefix, ...

     Standard configure options.  Generally you'd like to set --prefix,
     --localstatedir, --sysconfdir and so on.  Kahua applications,
     Kahua databases, log directories are normally deployed under
     ${localstatedir}/kahua, and the configuration file is
     ${sysconfdir}/etc/kahua.conf.

 --with-staticdir

     Kahua Servers and kahua-httpd search static contents(image files,
     CSS files, etc...) under this directory.
     Default: ${localstatedir}/kahua/static

 --with-fastcgi

     Install kahua.fcg, a Kahua Bridge FastCGI script.  You must
     install Gauche-fastcgi extension in advance.  Default: no
}}}

*** Self check

Just do this: 
{{{
% make check
}}}

*** Installing

Execute these commands as root.
{{{
% su
# make install
}}}

If you'd like to install sample applications, you should execute this
command as a Kahua developer(not root).

{{{
% make install-examples
}}}

And you must fix owner/group of the sample database like this:
{{{
% su
# chown -R kahua:kahua /usr/local/kahua/var/kahua/db*
}}}
You need * tail of above command line. Don't forget it.

*** Starting Kahua Servers

Congratulations! Now you can start Kahua Servers. Kahua Servers should
be invoked under "kahua" user privilege.

{{{
# su kahua -c ${prefix}/bin/kahua-spvr
}}}

This command invokes kahua-spvr, Kahua Supervisor command, and it
invokes kahua workers(kahua-server) and a key server(kahua-keyserv).
If you want to use it with Kahua Web Server(kahua-httpd), you just do
this:

{{{
# su kahua -c ${prefix}/bin/kahua-spvr --httpd localhost:8888
}}}

If you want that Kahua Servers run as background processes, you just
do like this:

{{{
# su kahua -c "(${prefix}/bin/kahua-spvr >>${localstatedir}/kahua/logs/kahua-error.log 2>&1 &)"
}}}

Kahua System doesn't yet have any mechanism that registers its startup
scripts to the operating system.  You must create them by hand, or you
can use "daemontools" to manage Kahua Servers processes.

----

** Build from CVS

To build and install the source from CVS Repository, you need autoconf
2.54 or later.  Also if you try CVS-HEAD of Kahua, you should usr
CVS-HEAD of Gauche.

Execute following command to create configure script to build the
source checked out from CVS.

{{{
% ./DIST gen
}}}

The procedure of build and install is same as released one.
