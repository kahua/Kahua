;;; Global session ID (GSID) -------------------------------------------
;;
;; Session ID consists of two strings.  One is a continuation ID, which
;; corresponds to a continuation of the session.   It can be restartable,
;; that is, the same continuation ID can be reused to backtrack the
;; session as far as it hasn't explicitly invalidated.  In other word,
;; a continuation ID has an unlimited extent by default.
;;
;; The other is a state ID, which stands for a monadic state of
;; the session.  It carries a stateful information---therefore can't
;; be backtracked.
;;
;; In a typical web session, the continuation ID is kept in parameters
;; in POST request or in URL, whereas the state ID is kept in cookies.
;;
;; Both ID consists of the following format:
;;
;;    1-HHHHH-BBBBBBB
;;
;; The first '1' desginates the GSID version.  Hs and Bs are for a header
;; and a body.  The format after the version number can be changed
;; in the later versions.  For version 1, the header just includes worker ID.
;; The body is up to the worker.  Hs and Bs shouldn't include a minus sign.
