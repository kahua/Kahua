* About Kahua


** What is Kahua?

Kahua is CPS, Continuation Passing Style application framework written
in one of scheme implementation, Gauche.

CPS has following advantages.

- You can use "Continuation" easily so you can resolve the typical Web
  Applicaiton's problem of process disconnection.
- You can program declaratively by using S-expressions as fundamental
  data type.
- You can use Kahua's Object Database to permanent data by itself.
- You can modify the function being run and it supports incremental
  development.

Gauche is an R5RS Scheme implementation that is designed to be a
useful tools for daily work. See http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/
in detail.

Kahua is licensed under the modified BSD license. See COPYING in detail.

"Kahua" means platform, location or base in Hawaiian.


** Fundamental data type

Kahua adopts S-expressions as fundamental data type and they allow
Kahua users declarative programming. S-expressions are known for their
use in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.


** Object Database

Kahua has Object Database and the contents described by Gauche can be
stored.

Additionaly, by S-expressions Kahua users can equally store static
HTML and dynamic program their.


** General-purpose application server

Kahua is not only for web application. Users can apply Kahua to rich
client application.


** Incremental development

Kahua is suitable for agile development.  Users are able to apply
dynamical and dialogical programming on Kahua.



* The Kahua Open Source Project

The Kahua open source project is currently hosted by TimeIntermedia
Corporation.  The purpose of the project is to play a leading role in
developing and promoting Kahua as a better CPS application framework.

The project's website is runnig on one of the Kahua Application,
"kahua-web".
